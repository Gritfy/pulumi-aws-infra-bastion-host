# pulumi-aws-infra-bastion-host
In this repo, I am trying to set up basic AWS infra which includes vpc, private + public subnets, route tables, internet gateway, nat gateway and one public ec2 instance and one private ec2 instance. Public ec2 instance is used as bastion host or jump server which is used to do ssh login into private instance
